# NewAge Health & Beauty Store

## Stack overview

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla).
- **Planned back-end:** Node.js with MySQL (data, orders, and user accounts).
- **Auth:** Email/password plus Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0).
- **Payments:** Stripe (planned).

## Local usage

Open `index.html` directly in a browser or serve the folder with a simple static server.

## Publish to GitHub

If you already created a GitHub repository, connect it as a remote and push the commit:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_REPO>.git
git push -u origin work
```

If your branch is named `main`, push that instead:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Next steps

- Connect category navigation to real product collections.
- Add product listings, filters, and a cart drawer.
- Wire API endpoints for search, auth, and checkout.
